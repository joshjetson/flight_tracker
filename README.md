# Flight Tracker Simulator
<table>
<tr>
<td>
  A webapp built using streamlit. Currently this app is only a simulation but it can be easily adapted to generate the realtime location of any commercial flight utilizing its on board instrument data. All data in the application is accurate aside from the actual simulated flight. The distance between two airports, the average flight time and the ability to detect which airports contain direct flights to each other are discussed below.

## Data
The data used in this application was sourced from historical flight data freely available online. The distance between two geographic locations is generated by utilzing the haversine formula. The average flight time between two airports was generated by averaging thousands of historical flights from one airport to another.





## Mobile support
The WebApp is compatible with devices of all sizes and all OS's, and consistent improvements are being made.
